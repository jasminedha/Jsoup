"Level Up","5.0 out of 5 stars Last long and cost less than name-brand batteries","I tend to buy well known name-brand D or E brand because of how long they last when comparing them to store brand batteries. I’m happy to report that these last just long as the brand name D or E batteries but cost less. I will no longer pay more for those name brand batteries as I am now converted and convinced of the longevity of these brand. I will only buy Amazon brand from now on as they’re cheaper and last just as long. For instance, I used these in my Christmas lights and it last the entire month of December and the first week of January; my lights were on timer and they came on everyday. I just took my lights down and the batteries are still good and can still be used which is normal for me with the name brand batteries I use to buy (D or E brand). Store brand usually dies before the end of December and I’d have to replace them, I was thinking this would’ve been the same results but it wasn’t and I’m so happy about that.

"Skip Gundlach","5.0 out of 5 stars AAbsolutely sufficient unto the usual tasks ☺","After dealing with the expensive-wherever-you-buy-them bulk AA batteries from 'name vendors' (Coppertop, Duracell, etc.), we tried Amazon's. Drastically more conveniently packaged, and - at least as far as we can tell - easily the equal of the 'name vendors' batteries, unless we need them right this minute, and aren't at home where our storehouse of staples like AA, AAA, and 9V batteries are kept, they're what you'll find in our various users of this size battery. And, as our grandkid (we have 17) visits grow in number, and a significant number of battery powered toys come along with some of them, having replacements for the various ones which die is even handier with the convenient storage boxes which keep them tidily and compactly secured against distribution randomly throughout the battery drawer! They don't (nor do most any others, much to my annoyance) have any amphour rating, the real measure of any battery. However, some electronics these days have a point at which they'll stop powering whatever it is you were using it in; e.g., our electric toothbrushes quit after 1.2 volts (a fully charged AA battery is usually right at 1.65-1.59 volts, e.g.). No non-rechargeable battery 'recovers' after 'resting' but if you have a fast rate of discharge, and then put down whatever it is which you're powering with it/them, you may find that you can get a few more minutes of use after a period of non-use. However, in our experience, it's a false hope, as that time is brief, and usually will fully exhaust the usable power just as you wish you had more. The good news is that these are so inexpensive by comparison that it's not worth trying to get the last few minutes of use from them instead of reaching for a fresh set. Using direct comparison, here's a 100-pack (you'll get the best pricing in bulk; smaller amounts are along the same lines of relative costs) of two ""name brands"" against these: https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Performance-Alkaline-Batteries-100-Pack/dp/B01B8R6PF2 @ 27.99 - except that if you're a gonzo user, you can ""subscribe and save"" to a regular shipment at a 40% discount! https://www.amazon.com/DURACELL-Duralock-Exclusive-Controllers-Batteries/dp/B0CFW3GJ2B/ 100 pack (5x20 packs bulk) @ 84.99 Or (requires 2) https://www.amazon.com/Duracell-Coppertop-Alkaline-Batteries-AA/dp/B00E8SG4F0/ref=sr_1_26 of 48 x 2@ $38.79 (net $77.58) https://www.amazon.com/Energizer-Max-Alkaline-Batteries-Made/dp/B00KMDL8U6/ref=sr_1_2 100 pack 47.04 except that if you're a gonzo user, you can ""subscribe and save"" to a regular shipment at a 40% discount, here, too.

"Level Up","5.0 out of 5 stars Last long and cost less than name-brand batteries","I tend to buy well known name-brand D or E brand because of how long they last when comparing them to store brand batteries. I’m happy to report that these last just long as the brand name D or E batteries but cost less. I will no longer pay more for those name brand batteries as I am now converted and convinced of the longevity of these brand. I will only buy Amazon brand from now on as they’re cheaper and last just as long. For instance, I used these in my Christmas lights and it last the entire month of December and the first week of January; my lights were on timer and they came on everyday. I just took my lights down and the batteries are still good and can still be used which is normal for me with the name brand batteries I use to buy (D or E brand). Store brand usually dies before the end of December and I’d have to replace them, I was thinking this would’ve been the same results but it wasn’t and I’m so happy about that.

"Skip Gundlach","5.0 out of 5 stars AAbsolutely sufficient unto the usual tasks ☺","After dealing with the expensive-wherever-you-buy-them bulk AA batteries from 'name vendors' (Coppertop, Duracell, etc.), we tried Amazon's. Drastically more conveniently packaged, and - at least as far as we can tell - easily the equal of the 'name vendors' batteries, unless we need them right this minute, and aren't at home where our storehouse of staples like AA, AAA, and 9V batteries are kept, they're what you'll find in our various users of this size battery. And, as our grandkid (we have 17) visits grow in number, and a significant number of battery powered toys come along with some of them, having replacements for the various ones which die is even handier with the convenient storage boxes which keep them tidily and compactly secured against distribution randomly throughout the battery drawer! They don't (nor do most any others, much to my annoyance) have any amphour rating, the real measure of any battery. However, some electronics these days have a point at which they'll stop powering whatever it is you were using it in; e.g., our electric toothbrushes quit after 1.2 volts (a fully charged AA battery is usually right at 1.65-1.59 volts, e.g.). No non-rechargeable battery 'recovers' after 'resting' but if you have a fast rate of discharge, and then put down whatever it is which you're powering with it/them, you may find that you can get a few more minutes of use after a period of non-use. However, in our experience, it's a false hope, as that time is brief, and usually will fully exhaust the usable power just as you wish you had more. The good news is that these are so inexpensive by comparison that it's not worth trying to get the last few minutes of use from them instead of reaching for a fresh set. Using direct comparison, here's a 100-pack (you'll get the best pricing in bulk; smaller amounts are along the same lines of relative costs) of two ""name brands"" against these: https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Performance-Alkaline-Batteries-100-Pack/dp/B01B8R6PF2 @ 27.99 - except that if you're a gonzo user, you can ""subscribe and save"" to a regular shipment at a 40% discount! https://www.amazon.com/DURACELL-Duralock-Exclusive-Controllers-Batteries/dp/B0CFW3GJ2B/ 100 pack (5x20 packs bulk) @ 84.99 Or (requires 2) https://www.amazon.com/Duracell-Coppertop-Alkaline-Batteries-AA/dp/B00E8SG4F0/ref=sr_1_26 of 48 x 2@ $38.79 (net $77.58) https://www.amazon.com/Energizer-Max-Alkaline-Batteries-Made/dp/B00KMDL8U6/ref=sr_1_2 100 pack 47.04 except that if you're a gonzo user, you can ""subscribe and save"" to a regular shipment at a 40% discount, here, too.

No non-rechargeable battery 'recovers' after 'resting' but if you have a fast rate of discharge, and then put down whatever it is which you're powering with it/them, you may find that you can get a few more minutes of use after a period of non-use. However, in our experience, it's a false hope, as that time is brief, and usually will fully exhaust the usable power just as you wish you had more. The good news is that these are so inexpensive by comparison that it's not worth trying to get the last few minutes of use from them instead of reaching for a fresh set.

I will no longer pay more for those name brand batteries as I am now converted and convinced of the longevity of these brand.

"Skip Gundlach","5.0 out of 5 stars AAbsolutely sufficient unto the usual tasks ☺","After dealing with the expensive-wherever-you-buy-them bulk AA batteries from 'name vendors' (Coppertop, Duracell, etc.), we tried Amazon's. Drastically more conveniently packaged, and - at least as far as we can tell - easily the equal of the 'name vendors' batteries, unless we need them right this minute, and aren't at home where our storehouse of staples like AA, AAA, and 9V batteries are kept, they're what you'll find in our various users of this size battery. And, as our grandkid (we have 17) visits grow in number, and a significant number of battery powered toys come along with some of them, having replacements for the various ones which die is even handier with the convenient storage boxes which keep them tidily and compactly secured against distribution randomly throughout the battery drawer! They don't (nor do most any others, much to my annoyance) have any amphour rating, the real measure of any battery. However, some electronics these days have a point at which they'll stop powering whatever it is you were using it in; e.g., our electric toothbrushes quit after 1.2 volts (a fully charged AA battery is usually right at 1.65-1.59 volts, e.g.). No non-rechargeable battery 'recovers' after 'resting' but if you have a fast rate of discharge, and then put down whatever it is which you're powering with it/them, you may find that you can get a few more minutes of use after a period of non-use. However, in our experience, it's a false hope, as that time is brief, and usually will fully exhaust the usable power just as you wish you had more. The good news is that these are so inexpensive by comparison that it's not worth trying to get the last few minutes of use from them instead of reaching for a fresh set. Using direct comparison, here's a 100-pack (you'll get the best pricing in bulk; smaller amounts are along the same lines of relative costs) of two ""name brands"" against these: https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Performance-Alkaline-Batteries-100-Pack/dp/B01B8R6PF2 @ 27.99 - except that if you're a gonzo user, you can ""subscribe and save"" to a regular shipment at a 40% discount! https://www.amazon.com/DURACELL-Duralock-Exclusive-Controllers-Batteries/dp/B0CFW3GJ2B/ 100 pack (5x20 packs bulk) @ 84.99 Or (requires 2) https://www.amazon.com/Duracell-Coppertop-Alkaline-Batteries-AA/dp/B00E8SG4F0/ref=sr_1_26 of 48 x 2@ $38.79 (net $77.58) https://www.amazon.com/Energizer-Max-Alkaline-Batteries-Made/dp/B00KMDL8U6/ref=sr_1_2 100 pack 47.04 except that if you're a gonzo user, you can ""subscribe and save"" to a regular shipment at a 40% discount, here, too.

"Skip Gundlach","5.0 out of 5 stars AAbsolutely sufficient unto the usual tasks ☺","After dealing with the expensive-wherever-you-buy-them bulk AA batteries from 'name vendors' (Coppertop, Duracell, etc.), we tried Amazon's. Drastically more conveniently packaged, and - at least as far as we can tell - easily the equal of the 'name vendors' batteries, unless we need them right this minute, and aren't at home where our storehouse of staples like AA, AAA, and 9V batteries are kept, they're what you'll find in our various users of this size battery. And, as our grandkid (we have 17) visits grow in number, and a significant number of battery powered toys come along with some of them, having replacements for the various ones which die is even handier with the convenient storage boxes which keep them tidily and compactly secured against distribution randomly throughout the battery drawer! They don't (nor do most any others, much to my annoyance) have any amphour rating, the real measure of any battery. However, some electronics these days have a point at which they'll stop powering whatever it is you were using it in; e.g., our electric toothbrushes quit after 1.2 volts (a fully charged AA battery is usually right at 1.65-1.59 volts, e.g.). No non-rechargeable battery 'recovers' after 'resting' but if you have a fast rate of discharge, and then put down whatever it is which you're powering with it/them, you may find that you can get a few more minutes of use after a period of non-use. However, in our experience, it's a false hope, as that time is brief, and usually will fully exhaust the usable power just as you wish you had more. The good news is that these are so inexpensive by comparison that it's not worth trying to get the last few minutes of use from them instead of reaching for a fresh set. Using direct comparison, here's a 100-pack (you'll get the best pricing in bulk; smaller amounts are along the same lines of relative costs) of two ""name brands"" against these: https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Performance-Alkaline-Batteries-100-Pack/dp/B01B8R6PF2 @ 27.99 - except that if you're a gonzo user, you can ""subscribe and save"" to a regular shipment at a 40% discount! https://www.amazon.com/DURACELL-Duralock-Exclusive-Controllers-Batteries/dp/B0CFW3GJ2B/ 100 pack (5x20 packs bulk) @ 84.99 Or (requires 2) https://www.amazon.com/Duracell-Coppertop-Alkaline-Batteries-AA/dp/B00E8SG4F0/ref=sr_1_26 of 48 x 2@ $38.79 (net $77.58) https://www.amazon.com/Energizer-Max-Alkaline-Batteries-Made/dp/B00KMDL8U6/ref=sr_1_2 100 pack 47.04 except that if you're a gonzo user, you can ""subscribe and save"" to a regular shipment at a 40% discount, here, too.

I’m happy to report that these last just long as the brand name D or E batteries but cost less. I will no longer pay more for those name brand batteries as I am now converted and convinced of the longevity of these brand. I will only buy Amazon brand from now on as they’re cheaper and last just as long. For instance, I used these in my Christmas lights and it last the entire month of December and the first week of January; my lights were on timer and they came on everyday. I just took my lights down and the batteries are still good and can still be used which is normal for me with the name brand batteries I use to buy (D or E brand). Store brand usually dies before the end of December and I’d have to replace them, I was thinking this would’ve been the same results but it wasn’t and I’m so happy about that.

"Skip Gundlach","5.0 out of 5 stars AAbsolutely sufficient unto the usual tasks ☺","After dealing with the expensive-wherever-you-buy-them bulk AA batteries from 'name vendors' (Coppertop, Duracell, etc.), we tried Amazon's. Drastically more conveniently packaged, and - at least as far as we can tell - easily the equal of the 'name vendors' batteries, unless we need them right this minute, and aren't at home where our storehouse of staples like AA, AAA, and 9V batteries are kept, they're what you'll find in our various users of this size battery. And, as our grandkid (we have 17) visits grow in number, and a significant number of battery powered toys come along with some of them, having replacements for the various ones which die is even handier with the convenient storage boxes which keep them tidily and compactly secured against distribution randomly throughout the battery drawer! They don't (nor do most any others, much to my annoyance) have any amphour rating, the real measure of any battery. However, some electronics these days have a point at which they'll stop powering whatever it is you were using it in; e.g., our electric toothbrushes quit after 1.2 volts (a fully charged AA battery is usually right at 1.65-1.59 volts, e.g.). No non-rechargeable battery 'recovers' after 'resting' but if you have a fast rate of discharge, and then put down whatever it is which you're powering with it/them, you may find that you can get a few more minutes of use after a period of non-use. However, in our experience, it's a false hope, as that time is brief, and usually will fully exhaust the usable power just as you wish you had more. The good news is that these are so inexpensive by comparison that it's not worth trying to get the last few minutes of use from them instead of reaching for a fresh set. Using direct comparison, here's a 100-pack (you'll get the best pricing in bulk; smaller amounts are along the same lines of relative costs) of two ""name brands"" against these: https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Performance-Alkaline-Batteries-100-Pack/dp/B01B8R6PF2 @ 27.99 - except that if you're a gonzo user, you can ""subscribe and save"" to a regular shipment at a 40% discount! https://www.amazon.com/DURACELL-Duralock-Exclusive-Controllers-Batteries/dp/B0CFW3GJ2B/ 100 pack (5x20 packs bulk) @ 84.99 Or (requires 2) https://www.amazon.com/Duracell-Coppertop-Alkaline-Batteries-AA/dp/B00E8SG4F0/ref=sr_1_26 of 48 x 2@ $38.79 (net $77.58) https://www.amazon.com/Energizer-Max-Alkaline-Batteries-Made/dp/B00KMDL8U6/ref=sr_1_2 100 pack 47.04 except that if you're a gonzo user, you can ""subscribe and save"" to a regular shipment at a 40% discount, here, too.

I will no longer pay more for those name brand batteries as I am now converted and convinced of the longevity of these brand. I will only buy Amazon brand from now on as they’re cheaper and last just as long. For instance, I used these in my Christmas lights and it last the entire month of December and the first week of January; my lights were on timer and they came on everyday. I just took my lights down and the batteries are still good and can still be used which is normal for me with the name brand batteries I use to buy (D or E brand).

"Skip Gundlach","5.0 out of 5 stars AAbsolutely sufficient unto the usual tasks ☺","After dealing with the expensive-wherever-you-buy-them bulk AA batteries from 'name vendors' (Coppertop, Duracell, etc.), we tried Amazon's. Drastically more conveniently packaged, and - at least as far as we can tell - easily the equal of the 'name vendors' batteries, unless we need them right this minute, and aren't at home where our storehouse of staples like AA, AAA, and 9V batteries are kept, they're what you'll find in our various users of this size battery. And, as our grandkid (we have 17) visits grow in number, and a significant number of battery powered toys come along with some of them, having replacements for the various ones which die is even handier with the convenient storage boxes which keep them tidily and compactly secured against distribution randomly throughout the battery drawer! They don't (nor do most any others, much to my annoyance) have any amphour rating, the real measure of any battery. However, some electronics these days have a point at which they'll stop powering whatever it is you were using it in; e.g., our electric toothbrushes quit after 1.2 volts (a fully charged AA battery is usually right at 1.65-1.59 volts, e.g.). No non-rechargeable battery 'recovers' after 'resting' but if you have a fast rate of discharge, and then put down whatever it is which you're powering with it/them, you may find that you can get a few more minutes of use after a period of non-use. However, in our experience, it's a false hope, as that time is brief, and usually will fully exhaust the usable power just as you wish you had more. The good news is that these are so inexpensive by comparison that it's not worth trying to get the last few minutes of use from them instead of reaching for a fresh set. Using direct comparison, here's a 100-pack (you'll get the best pricing in bulk; smaller amounts are along the same lines of relative costs) of two ""name brands"" against these: https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Performance-Alkaline-Batteries-100-Pack/dp/B01B8R6PF2 @ 27.99 - except that if you're a gonzo user, you can ""subscribe and save"" to a regular shipment at a 40% discount! https://www.amazon.com/DURACELL-Duralock-Exclusive-Controllers-Batteries/dp/B0CFW3GJ2B/ 100 pack (5x20 packs bulk) @ 84.99 Or (requires 2) https://www.amazon.com/Duracell-Coppertop-Alkaline-Batteries-AA/dp/B00E8SG4F0/ref=sr_1_26 of 48 x 2@ $38.79 (net $77.58) https://www.amazon.com/Energizer-Max-Alkaline-Batteries-Made/dp/B00KMDL8U6/ref=sr_1_2 100 pack 47.04 except that if you're a gonzo user, you can ""subscribe and save"" to a regular shipment at a 40% discount, here, too.

"Devante G","5.0 out of 5 stars Good Performance","These batteries seem to last a long time like the big brand batteries that you would expect. Much cheaper buying a bit set like this than purchasing a few at a time.

They primarily get used when my son forgets to charge his xbox controller. They aren't the longest life AA batteries out there, but the price is right and they last much longer than any off-brand batteries we have tried.","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2024","Size: 48 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase"

"Level Up","5.0 out of 5 stars Last long and cost less than name-brand batteries","I tend to buy well known name-brand D or E brand because of how long they last when comparing them to store brand batteries. I’m happy to report that these last just long as the brand name D or E batteries but cost less. I will no longer pay more for those name brand batteries as I am now converted and convinced of the longevity of these brand. I will only buy Amazon brand from now on as they’re cheaper and last just as long. For instance, I used these in my Christmas lights and it last the entire month of December and the first week of January; my lights were on timer and they came on everyday. I just took my lights down and the batteries are still good and can still be used which is normal for me with the name brand batteries I use to buy (D or E brand). Store brand usually dies before the end of December and I’d have to replace them, I was thinking this would’ve been the same results but it wasn’t and I’m so happy about that. I’m happy to find alternatives so I can now save my wallet a bit. Definitely recommend!","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2024","Size: 48 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase"

"Skip Gundlach","5.0 out of 5 stars AAbsolutely sufficient unto the usual tasks ☺","After dealing with the expensive-wherever-you-buy-them bulk AA batteries from 'name vendors' (Coppertop, Duracell, etc.), we tried Amazon's. Drastically more conveniently packaged, and - at least as far as we can tell - easily the equal of the 'name vendors' batteries, unless we need them right this minute, and aren't at home where our storehouse of staples like AA, AAA, and 9V batteries are kept, they're what you'll find in our various users of this size battery. And, as our grandkid (we have 17) visits grow in number, and a significant number of battery powered toys come along with some of them, having replacements for the various ones which die is even handier with the convenient storage boxes which keep them tidily and compactly secured against distribution randomly throughout the battery drawer! They don't (nor do most any others, much to my annoyance) have any amphour rating, the real measure of any battery. However, some electronics these days have a point at which they'll stop powering whatever it is you were using it in; e.g., our electric toothbrushes quit after 1.2 volts (a fully charged AA battery is usually right at 1.65-1.59 volts, e.g.). No non-rechargeable battery 'recovers' after 'resting' but if you have a fast rate of discharge, and then put down whatever it is which you're powering with it/them, you may find that you can get a few more minutes of use after a period of non-use. However, in our experience, it's a false hope, as that time is brief, and usually will fully exhaust the usable power just as you wish you had more. The good news is that these are so inexpensive by comparison that it's not worth trying to get the last few minutes of use from them instead of reaching for a fresh set. Using direct comparison, here's a 100-pack (you'll get the best pricing in bulk; smaller amounts are along the same lines of relative costs) of two ""name brands"" against these: https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Performance-Alkaline-Batteries-100-Pack/dp/B01B8R6PF2 @ 27.99 - except that if you're a gonzo user, you can ""subscribe and save"" to a regular shipment at a 40% discount! https://www.amazon.com/DURACELL-Duralock-Exclusive-Controllers-Batteries/dp/B0CFW3GJ2B/ 100 pack (5x20 packs bulk) @ 84.99 Or (requires 2) https://www.amazon.com/Duracell-Coppertop-Alkaline-Batteries-AA/dp/B00E8SG4F0/ref=sr_1_26 of 48 x 2@ $38.79 (net $77.58) https://www.amazon.com/Energizer-Max-Alkaline-Batteries-Made/dp/B00KMDL8U6/ref=sr_1_2 100 pack 47.04 except that if you're a gonzo user, you can ""subscribe and save"" to a regular shipment at a 40% discount, here, too. So, the best comparison (Energizer) is still $47.04 vs Amazon's 27.99, both delivered free under Prime. Guess which batteries you'll find in OUR battery drawer...","Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2024","Size: 48 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase"
